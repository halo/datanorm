DATANORM is a data format from the 90s for exporting and importing a list of product descriptions and their prices. Unfortunately, it's still widely used in Germany.

This gem parses both v4 from 1994 and v5 from 1999.

Only supports `.001` - `.999` files (not `.WRG` and not `.RAB`).

I don't think it will ever be feature-complete, but you're free to add a pull request to improve it.
